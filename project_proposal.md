## Proposal

### Domain Background

This project will focus on the Natural Language Processing domain of Machine Learning. This domain has had incredible surge in the last few months specially with the rise of Large Language Models in the form of ChatGPT and GPT-4. I have always been passionate about human language and how language communicates what is going around us; making this a great opportunity for me to learn more and get hands on in the subject. This project will use a very common way of electronic human communication, Twitter, to predict when and where a possible disaster is ocurring. This is actually a very common problem that emergency response and news organizations around the world use in their day to day monitoring operations. 

The problem was sourced from a competition in Kaggle "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" and a few of the problem statement and resources used in this proposal will be correctly attributed to the Kaggle site and author. Another related article in the subject is "Identification of Disaster-Related Tweets Using Natural Language Processing: International Conference on Recent Trends in Artificial Intelligence, IOT, Smart Cities & Applications (ICAISC-2020)" by Goswami et.al.


### Problem Statement

As described in the Domain background, Twitter has emerged as a top social platform for users to communicate in real-time about real-life events like emergencies or events that affect the course of their everyday lives. This makes it a prime data generation source for monitoring of such events in order to identify and disseminate knowledge if deemed applicable. The challenge relies on the volume and nature of the data posted by individuals. Not every tweet is related to an emergency and furthermore detecting if a specific tweet relates to a critical event in nature has proven challenging. For example, some words that regular individuals could use to identify an ongoing fire like "ablaze" could also be used in other contexts like talking about a spectacular sundown. 

This project will aim to build a Machine Learning model that can correctly identify a tweet as related to an emergency situation with a binary output. The project will rely on a database of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. This project was sourced from a Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets". 

### Datasets and Inputs

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.



### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
